Project Overview
****************
Preterm birth has a complex etiology, arising from environmental, biological, genetic, and behavioral factors. Premature infants (born between 22 and 37 weeks of gestation) are at risk for many negative, long-term health issues.\cite{goldenberg2008epidemiology}
health issues, including breathing and feeding difficulties, hearing and vision problems, neurodevelopmental delay, and even death.
\cite{goldenberg2008epidemiology} While there are several well-established risk factors, the prediction of individual births still remains a challenge.\cite{akazawa2022prediction} The preterm birth rate in the United States is approximately 10\% overall, with highest rates occurring among Black women (14.6\%), and lowest rates occurring among White (9.4\%) and Hispanic women (10.1\%).\cite{noauthor_2023-pi} These rates have recently declined for White women but remained unchanged for other groups.\cite{martin2021exploring} %Additionally, while preterm birth rates declined 1\% for singleton births among White women from 2019-2020, preterm birth rates among all other races and ethnicities remained unchanged.\cite{martin2021exploring} Recent focus on health disparities in the United States has highlighted the impact of social determinants of health.\cite{emeruwa2022health} Under-representation in healthcare research contributes to racial and ethnic health disparities.\cite{vajdic2013reaching} %Our project seeks to bridge the disparity in preterm births and ensure that all communities benefit from healthcare research and technology. By using a representative dataset and non-invasive metrics, and ensuring our model’s equitable performance across diverse racial and ethnic groups, we aim to contribute to a healthier start for all children.
