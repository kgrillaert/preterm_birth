# Project Description

### ***“The world is facing a silent emergency. . . of preterm births.” - UNICEF<sup>1</sup>***

Premature infants are at risk for many negative, long-term health issues.<sup>2</sup> The preterm birth
rate in the United States is approximately 10% overall, with highest rates occurring among Black women
(14.6%), and lowest rates occurring among White (9.4%) and Hispanic women (10.1%).<sup>3</sup> These rates have
recently declined for White women but remained unchanged for other groups.<sup>4</sup> Under-representation in
healthcare research contributes to racial and ethnic health disparities.<sup>5</sup> Therefore, by using a representative 
dataset and non-invasive metrics, and ensuring our model’s equitable performance across diverse
racial and ethnic groups, we aim to contribute to a healthier start for all children.

We constructed two models to predict preterm birth, one with demographic features and
one with lifestyle features. Our data source was the National Institute of Health’s All of Us Research
Program controlled tier of de-identified medical data. The Demographics model was trained on a dataset
of 13690 births between the years 2009 and 2022. Most demographic information for each individual was
available only as summary statistics based on their zip code. Race and ethnicity were available on the
individual level. The Lifestyle model was trained on a dataset of 7XXX births between the years X and
Z. Features explored include drinking, smoking, body mass index, and XYZZZ.
